When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When you want to allow others to access your repository and suggest changes to it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because you may not necessarily want all changes in the remote repository
    to be reflected in your local files.
