When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When you want to allow others to access your repository and suggest changes to it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because you may not necessarily want all changes in the remote repository
    to be reflected in your local files.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    A fork is just a clone that GitHub makes for you on their own machines.
    A clone is a duplicate repository that you can make locally on your own
    machine (from GitHub or from your own machine).  A branch is an alternate
    version existing within a single repository.
